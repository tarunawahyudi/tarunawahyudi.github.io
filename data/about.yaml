  description: I am a driven individual with the ability to adapt to any situation and proven potential to grow self and others. I have been developing professionally for 5 years but tinkering since a kid. I started in tech with internships, freelance services and part time positions during college. I have a bit off a diverse job history. I have had positions in help desk, graphic/web design, wordpress development and network engineer. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in software engineering.
